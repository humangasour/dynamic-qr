-- ===== Seed Data for Development
-- This file contains initial data for local development

-- Note: In production, you would typically not have seed data
-- This is only for local development and testing

-- You can add sample organizations, users, or QR codes here if needed
-- For now, we'll leave it empty as the schema is sufficient for MVP development

-- Example seed data (uncomment if needed during development):
/*
-- Sample organization
INSERT INTO public.orgs (id, name, plan) VALUES 
  ('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', 'Demo Corp', 'free');

-- Sample user (this would be created by Supabase Auth)
INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, name) VALUES 
  ('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001', 'demo@example.com', 'Demo User');

-- Sample org membership
INSERT INTO public.org_members (org_id, user_id, role) VALUES 
  ('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001', 'owner');
